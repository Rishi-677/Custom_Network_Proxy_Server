# Test Artifacts – Multithreaded HTTP/HTTPS Proxy Server

This document contains representative test cases used to validate the functional correctness, robustness, concurrency behavior, and fault handling of the proxy server. Each test case records the purpose of the test, the command used to trigger it, the observed runtime behavior, and the corresponding log output generated by the server.

## 1. HTTP Request Forwarding

**Purpose**  
Verify that standard HTTP requests are correctly forwarded to upstream servers and responses are relayed back to clients.

**Command-Basic HTTP GET**
```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://example.com
```

**Observed Behavior**
The client receives the HTTP response from the upstream server and the request completes successfully.

**Log Output**
```bash
[2026-01-05 14:10:21] 127.0.0.1:53422 | "GET / HTTP/1.0" | example.com:80 | ALLOWED | 200 | bytes=1256
```

**Command-HTTP GET with Explicit Path**
```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://example.com/index.html
```

**Observed Behavior**
The proxy forwards the request with the correct path, and the client receives the expected resource.

**Log Output**
```bash
[2026-01-05 14:10:45] 127.0.0.1:53426 | "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0" | example.com:80 | ALLOWED | 200 | bytes=978
```

## 1. HTTPS Request Tunneling

**Purpose**  
Verify that HTTPS traffic is tunneled using the CONNECT method without decrypting or inspecting encrypted data.

**Command-Root**
```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://example.com
```

**Observed Behavior**
The TLS handshake completes successfully and the HTTPS response is returned to the client.

**Log Output**
```bash
[2026-01-05 14:11:03] 127.0.0.1:53430 | "CONNECT HTTP/1.0" | example.com:443 | ALLOWED | 200 | bytes=8421
```

**Command-Explicit Path**
```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://example.com/docs
```

**Observed Behavior**
The proxy establishes a tunnel using CONNECT and transparently forwards encrypted traffic containing the explicit path.

**Log Output**
```bash
[2026-01-05 14:11:25] 127.0.0.1:53434 | "CONNECT HTTP/1.0" | example.com:443 | ALLOWED | 200 | bytes=9012
```
